Csr-generator is a small library to create SeaDataNet Cruise Summary Report (CSR) files based on plain old java objects (POJOs).

The POJOs are presented as interfaces, so when using this library you must implement these. A reference implementation is available in the test packages, and can be recuperated without problem.
