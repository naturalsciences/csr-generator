# CSR Generator

Csr-generator is a small Java library to create SeaDataNet Cruise Summary Report (CSR) files based on plain old java objects (POJOs).

The POJOs are defined as interfaces in the cruise-api library (https://github.com/naturalsciences/cruise-api),
You must implement these as non-abstract classes. A reference implementation is available in the test packages, and can be recuperated without problem.
